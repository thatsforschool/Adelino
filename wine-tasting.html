                        The wine tasting classes are based on Portuguese  education for individuals with an interest in wine.<br>
                        The training is offered by Adelino "smag af Portugal" www.adelino.dk, and has existed for many years.<br> 
                        It is recognized by the Danish ministry of agriculture & food.<br>
                        <br>
                        A wine tasting usually offers tastings of 8 different wines, and has a duration of approx. 2-3 hours.<br>
                         here you will be introduced to the exciting wine country of portugal, mixed with a bit of history and culture.<br>
                        <br>
                        Tapas as a meal or snacks and small snacks, can be purchased.<br>
                        You hear about the different wine regions, grapes and of course you also have to taste the wines.<br>

                        The atmosphere was relaxed, the content was exciting and light enough to be digested 
                        across the table along with the delicious wine and food.

                        Christina dished up lots of goodies, and everything harmonized; there was simply nothing 
                        missing, except maybe a little more space in the stomach :-)

                        In any case, I have not felt less like taking the trip to Portugal myself.

                        We were so lucky to join Vin og Tapas with Christina Da Silva from Adelino.

                        We had a super nice evening where we got around the taste of Portugal
                        Wines and port wines of different kinds, which could hit many different taste buds.
                        It was all served professionally with Tapas which went super well with what to drink.

                        <br>
                        We ended up ordering some of what we had tasted - and this is certainly not the last order.

                        <br>
                        More than full satisfaction from here.
